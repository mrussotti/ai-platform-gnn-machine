And how old is she?\n 0109.4s 0111.0s SPEAKER_01:  She is 75.\n 0116.1s 0117.1s SPEAKER_00:  And...\n 0118.0s 0120.7s SPEAKER_00:  When she fell yesterday, was she bleeding from anywhere?\n 0121.7s 0126.4s SPEAKER_01:  No. No, she slept on the steps.\n 0127.9s 0141.2s SPEAKER_01:  She did something to her leg, her knee, or something. I'm not sure what. But it's definitely she cannot get up and walk right now, even with trying to help support her for using the King.\n 0141.9s 0146.6s SPEAKER_00:  And does anybody in the residence have a cough, fever, any of the COVID symptoms?\n 0147.8s 0148.2s SPEAKER_01:  No.\n 0152.1s 0156.5s SPEAKER_00:  And did she lose consciousness yesterday when she fell?\n 0157.5s 0160.4s SPEAKER_01:  No, no. She actually.\n 0161.2s 0165.7s SPEAKER_01:  called to the door, well, she's on the steps, she called to the door to get my attention.\n 0166.4s 0168.2s SPEAKER_01:  And we got her in here.\n 0169.1s 0170.1s SPEAKER_01:  And...\n 0171.1s 0174.7s SPEAKER_01:  I got her to the couch and she spent the night on the couch.\n 0175.5s 0186.6s SPEAKER_01:  And actually, after this, she was actually able to really, really slowly recover to the bathroom at the back. Now this morning, when she's gone,\n 0187.2s 0193.4s SPEAKER_01:  Well, this morning, she couldn't do that again. She couldn't even get her to the bathroom. So.\n 0194.4s 0197.4s SPEAKER_00:  Is she able to respond to you and follow simple commands?\n 0198.7s 0202.5s SPEAKER_01:  Oh yes, yes. She's... Yes.

She's not short of breath or anything like that now.\n 0215.0s 0225.3s SPEAKER_01:  No, she's not sure, but the main thing seems to be some kind of an injury to the leg, the knee, something that prevents her from putting weed on it, which is the problem.\n 0225.9s 0232.4s SPEAKER_00:  Like I said, my partner's already started the medics. If you could gather up her medications or if you have a list of what she's taking.\n 0233.8s 0234.0s SPEAKER_00:  Fairly.\n 0234.0s 0234.9s SPEAKER_01:  available.\n 0235.6s 0236.6s SPEAKER_00:  Yeah\n 0236.2s 0237.6s SPEAKER_01:  for medications.\n 0236.2s 0237.6s SPEAKER_01:  for medications.\n 0238.4s 0239.5s SPEAKER_01:  Right, we can do that.\n 0239.7s 0245.4s SPEAKER_00:  Okay. And if anything changes before they get there, just give us a call back. But we have them on their way.\n 0246.9s 0257.8s SPEAKER_01:  Okay, thank you though. Oh, because I called 911, I presume it would be best to have a number to call as opposed to calling 911 again, if anything.\n 0259.4s 0262.7s SPEAKER_01:  Is that correct? Well, you... Just call 911 again.\n 0262.9s 0264.8s SPEAKER_00:  Yes, you can call 911.\n 0265.8s 0269.7s SPEAKER_01:  Okay, all right. And that's if anything changes. Is that what you said?\n 0270.2s 0275.4s SPEAKER_00:  Yeah, before they get there, if anything else happens, call us and let the medics know.\n 0275.4s 0282.8s SPEAKER_01:  Okay, well right now she's sitting on the couch and I'm not expecting anything to change. We should be good.\n 0276.6s 0276.8s SPEAKER_00:  Well.\n 0284.8s 0287.5s SPEAKER_01:  All right. Thank you. Thank you very much.\n 0288.4s 0289.7s SPEAKER_01:  Bye.",
