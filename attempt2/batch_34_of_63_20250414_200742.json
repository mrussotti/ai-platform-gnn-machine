She's had multiple falls over the last couple of weeks. She actually also has bruising to the left side of her chest near the shoulder area. That's new from last night. Okay. She has bruising on the right side. Same exact area on the right side, but that was from last week.\n 0023.4s 0024.0s SPEAKER_01:  Okay.\n 0024.0s 0024.8s SPEAKER_00:  Do you know what she's like?\n 0024.8s 0025.5s SPEAKER_01:  And it on.\n 0025.5s 0033.0s SPEAKER_00:  I do not know. The family, she is down here in a downstairs bedroom, so they don't necessarily witness the falls. They just find her.\n 0033.6s 0036.4s SPEAKER_00:  and she's got dementia so she's not able to tell.\n 0036.6s 0042.3s SPEAKER_01:  Okay. And so you're not sure she lost consciousness? Correct. Um, please.\n 0042.3s 0044.6s SPEAKER_00:  She didn't, but...\n 0045.5s 0046.6s SPEAKER_00:  You know, I'm not sure.\n 0045.6s 0049.5s SPEAKER_01:  You know, I'm not sure. You've got a bump on the head, on the top.\n 0048.9s 0053.0s SPEAKER_00:  On the top and the head. Yeah, it's like on the posterior, like port the crown.\n 0054.5s 0061.3s SPEAKER_00:  And it fits about in the palm of your hand. It's about that big. It's covered in dried blood, so I can't really tell you what it looks like underneath it.\n 0065.1s 0068.8s SPEAKER_01:  All right, but she can respond to you and follow a simple command? Yes.\n 0070.4s 0072.7s SPEAKER_01:  Any shortness of breath? No.\n 0073.3s 0079.9s SPEAKER_01:  Okay. Did she complain of any pain or illness? I know that before the ball, I know you weren't there, so...\n 0079.9s 0083.3s SPEAKER_00:  No, no, she typically doesn't complain.\n 0083.3s 0109.7s SPEAKER_01:  All right. Well, just tell her not to move. Don't splint any injuries. Nothing to eat or drink. And if you can just gather her medications or lists to give to the medics. And if anything changes or worsens, go ahead and give us a call back. But they're around 55 East Reindeer Drive, okay? Okay. What did you say about meds? They need a med list? If you can just grab a med list so the medics can take a look at that.\n 0110.4s 0116.6s SPEAKER_01:  OK, that would be great. OK, perfect. All right, thank you. Thank you. Bye bye.",
