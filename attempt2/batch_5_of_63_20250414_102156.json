There wasn't.\n 0088.3s 0150.0s SPEAKER_00:  It worked for a few hours. Now every about 60 seconds it's telling me it's clogged again. I know it's very important that this machine works. That way I don't get an infection again, because if I do, I have to get my foot amputated. And I don't know what else to do. I try calling the emergency room. The lady was very disrespectful, would not help me. She told me to call the wound care clinic that I go to. There's nobody there. They're not there. They're there Monday through Friday. She told me to listen to the automatic recording to see if there is a way to get to on call doctor. I don't know what else to do. That's why I called you guys. I have a nurse scheduled to come out in my house tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the morning to change my wound vat dressing. I don't know if it's safe for me to not have my machine working for 12 hours. You know what I mean? I'm terrified, because I've been through so many surgeries the last few years. I don't want to lose any more of my limbs. And I just I really don't know what to do. And I'm really scared. I can't drive and stuff like that. And I don't know what else to do.\n 0150.0s 0157.1s SPEAKER_01:  Okay, well, my partner did go ahead and get the medics started that way, even if it's just to come check it out and make sure everything's working properly with it. How old are you?\n 0158.2s 0178.4s SPEAKER_00:  I'm 32 years old and I'm like I'm like I have an enjoy here so for best like I'm freaking out real bad right now because like I got really lucky that I didn't lose my foot and like I know it can go south really fast so that's the reason I call 911 and like I hate to waste time because I know it's 10 years and there's other stuff going on but like I don't know I don't have any other options I don't know what to do.\n 0178.7s 0189.4s SPEAKER_01:  Oh no, you're fine. I would probably be in the same boat as you if my foot were on the line. I wouldn't want to get it amputated either. Have you had COVID or had any symptoms of COVID or under doctor's orders of quarantine?\n 0178.7s 0189.4s SPEAKER_01:  Oh no, you're fine. I would probably be in the same boat as you if my foot were on the line. I wouldn't want to get it amputated either. Have you had COVID or had any symptoms of COVID or under doctor's orders of quarantine?\n 0190.3s 0196.3s SPEAKER_00:  No ma'am and I did and I think it tested a week ago and it came back negative and all I've been I've been home since And I haven't won anywhere\n 0203.2s 0209.8s SPEAKER_01:  Other than what's going on with the wound bag, is anything else? Do you have any other symptoms? Anything along those lines? Everything's okay.\n 0210.6s 0211.2s SPEAKER_00:  I'm just.\n 0211.9s 0224.5s SPEAKER_00:  I'm really nervous. I'm hyperventilating a little bit because I'm terrified right now. I got real lucky not losing my foot. That's my worst fear. I'm just ending up back in the hospital and losing another limb.\n 0224.9s 0227.0s SPEAKER_01:  Right. Is the door unlocked for the medics when they get there?\n 0227.9s 0229.9s SPEAKER_00:  It will be yes ma'am\n 0231.1s 0236.6s SPEAKER_00:  I can't walk half to hop around. I can't put a new weight on my foot, so I have to hop around and so like that.\n 0237.0s 0245.7s SPEAKER_01:  We do have two medics coming out there too. If you're able to stay in the position of comfort, if you're on any medications, just gather that up, give it to the medics when they get there. If anything changes, call me back, okay?\n 0246.6s 0247.0s SPEAKER_00:  Yes, ma'am.\n 0246.7s 0248.7s SPEAKER_01:  Okay. All right. Take care, Donna.\n 0249.6s 0252.6s SPEAKER_01:  Thank you so much.
