He is positive COVID.\n 0058.8s 0090.1s SPEAKER_00:  He also, I believe, has some kind of infection in his lefthony and is currently incapable of getting himself up off the floor. He weighs close to 300 pounds. I weigh 100 pounds. I can't get him up. Is he injured or just need help up? He just needs help up. So I didn't know if I should call you guys or if there was somebody else I should call. He needs to go to a hospital and be seen, but I can't get him up off the floor. What do I do? Okay.

Did he injure it when he fell or he just, he...\n 0134.0s 0140.6s SPEAKER_00:  He has and I know. He has not fallen. I think he was septic a year and a half ago and it's seated in that same knee.\n 0141.2s 0149.0s SPEAKER_00:  And he's acting now like he did then. I think that there's probably an infection and it's gotten so bad. It's causing him so much pain that he can't move.\n 0149.5s 0150.1s SPEAKER_01:  Okay.\n 0150.9s 0151.6s SPEAKER_01:  All right.\n 0152.8s 0155.3s SPEAKER_01:  Give me one second here.
