And he looked stunned and dazed and I said, are you okay buddy? And he said, well I'm not saying you're okay. And he started acting a little weird.

I discovered he took the first round of antibiotics and didn't take any more yesterday. So I got them from him. I have been giving them to him today. So he took it this morning until it's night. But that's it. Okay. So, and since he came back from the hospital because he did not take his antibiotics, the staphon section went from bad to worse. His whole body has broke out in red hives or I don't know what you would call them, like pustules. His whole entire body is covered in them.\n 0186.7s 0188.7s SPEAKER_00:  His body is broken out and what, sir?\n 0189.3s 0192.7s SPEAKER_01:  like red welts or balms or I mean like hundreds of them.\n 0193.8s 0194.2s SPEAKER_00:  OK.\n 0196.3s 0200.2s SPEAKER_01:  which when I read up on them, that is associated with a staph infection getting worse.\n 0200.9s 0203.5s SPEAKER_01:  All right.

What's your guess? He just got out of jail a week or so ago, and he's been trying to do good since then. You know, has he fallen off the wagon once or twice? Pretty good chance. Okay. Has he been using every day? No. And I haven't seen any sign of it tonight. I just wanted to call it. I have a lot of Narcan on hand because of his prior history, so just the first thing I thought was him and Narcan, just to be safe.\n 0245.1s 0247.7s SPEAKER_00:  No, I understand completely.
