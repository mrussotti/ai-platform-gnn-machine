So in the meantime, just make sure you're not endangering yourself. Keep everyone away at this point. If it's only, if you're only seeing that white smoke right now and it doesn't appear to be burning, just let it do its thing for now. Make sure no one's going into the shed to try and retrieve anything. And then any signs or symptoms of COVID for anyone in the area.
