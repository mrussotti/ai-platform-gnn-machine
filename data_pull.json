And he looked stunned and dazed and I said, are you okay buddy? And he said, well I'm not saying you're okay. And he started acting a little weird. And so I brought him up and sat him down in his chair.\\n 0043.5s 0043.8s SPEAKER_00:  One.\\n 0061.0s 0065.6s SPEAKER_01:  I cannot describe what he's doing. Do you think that he's overdosed on something?\\n 0066.4s 0078.3s SPEAKER_01:  At first I thought maybe he saw him with Mark Ann, but it didn't seem like a difference, and this is not nobody to overdose. He will take the possess by fucking faking. That's the best I can tell you. He was screaming weird, all pissed at me.\\n 0078.6s 0080.7s SPEAKER_00:  You gave him Narcan and it didn't work?\\n 0082.0s 0083.5s SPEAKER_01:  Yeah, not really.\\n 0083.1s 0085.8s SPEAKER_00:  And you said he looks like he's left for death?\\n 0086.3s 0092.3s SPEAKER_01:  Yeah, yeah, I do not think it's an opioid overdose. He has a very severe staffing infection and I'm afraid maybe it's...\\n 0093.2s 0095.7s SPEAKER_01:  reaching that point or something. I don't know.\\n 0096.3s 0098.3s SPEAKER_01:  or whatever they call it.\\n 0098.8s 0101.4s SPEAKER_00:  Okay, so you think he's ill from the staph infection?\\n 0101.7s 0112.1s SPEAKER_01:  I think so. I mean, I can't describe this. This is the weirdest damn thing I've ever seen. And that's why I don't think it's no big over those years. I've seen about 100 of those and I've never seen nothing like this.\\n 0112.9s 0119.1s SPEAKER_01:  and he's conscious, but he hears he moved the exorcist, that's what I'm fucking looking at.\\n 0119.6s 0122.1s SPEAKER_00:  Okay, so he is conscious and breathing for you, correct?\\n 0122.1s 0124.0s SPEAKER_01:  Yeah, yeah, respond to it, yeah.\\n 0124.3s 0124.9s SPEAKER_00:  All right.\\n 0124.9s 0133.2s SPEAKER_01:  He's constantly burning and freezing at the same time and he's making weird, like he has Tourette's syndrome, making weird noises.\\n 0133.8s 0137.1s SPEAKER_01:  I can't describe it.\\n 0135.8s 0139.0s SPEAKER_00:  Can you ask him if he's taken anything?\\n 0139.5s 0142.7s SPEAKER_01:  I have several times and I've gotten a negative response every time.\\n 0143.1s 0144.5s SPEAKER_00:  and how old is he?\\n 0145.4s 0148.8s SPEAKER_01:  Ah, 27, 28. I'm sorry. That's OK.\\n 0149.3s 0150.3s SPEAKER_00:  No, that's okay. I have...\\n 0150.2s 0152.8s SPEAKER_01:  It's just a birthday, it's October 26th, 1994.\\n 0153.0s 0157.8s SPEAKER_00:  Okay, I have help coming to you. So he does have an infection as well, correct?\\n 0158.0s 0186.8s SPEAKER_01:  He had a very severe staphon section and he came to you guys a couple of days ago with it. He gave me some antibiotics. I discovered he took the first round of antibiotics and didn't take any more yesterday. So I got them from him. I have been giving them to him today. So he took it this morning until it's night. But that's it. Okay. So, and since he came back from the hospital because he did not take his antibiotics, the staphon section went from bad to worse. His whole body has broke out in red hives or I don't know what you would call them, like pustules. His whole entire body is covered in them.\\n 0186.7s 0188.7s SPEAKER_00:  His body is broken out and what, sir?\\n 0189.3s 0192.7s SPEAKER_01:  like red welts or balms or I mean like hundreds of them.\\n 0193.8s 0194.2s SPEAKER_00:  OK.\\n 0196.3s 0200.2s SPEAKER_01:  which when I read up on them, that is associated with a staph infection getting worse.\\n 0200.9s 0203.5s SPEAKER_01:  All right. Which would make sense because he didn't take his hand by heart.\\n 0203.6s 0211.7s SPEAKER_00:  Yep, I understand. We have a lot of help coming to you. I just need to ask. So he is conscious and he is breathing.

What's your guess? He just got out of jail a week or so ago, and he's been trying to do good since then. You know, has he fallen off the wagon once or twice? Pretty good chance. Okay. Has he been using every day? No. And I haven't seen any sign of it tonight. I just wanted to call it. I have a lot of Narcan on hand because of his prior history, so just the first thing I thought was him and Narcan, just to be safe.\\n 0245.1s 0247.7s SPEAKER_00:  No, I understand completely. Is he violent in any way?\\n 0248.6s 0249.1s SPEAKER_01:  No.\\n 0249.7s 0251.5s SPEAKER_01:  You'd think you were supposed to write it now, but no.\\n 0251.9s 0253.6s SPEAKER_00:  Does he have access to any weapons?\\n 0254.3s 0254.6s SPEAKER_00:  No.\\n 0255.6s 0256.2s SPEAKER_00:  Okay.\\n 0257.5s 0259.1s SPEAKER_00:  and you're safe with him now?\\n 0260.0s 0262.4s SPEAKER_00:  Yes, Chris.
